- Accent color: White (#FFFFFF) for text and general interface elements to ensure readability against the dark background.
- Highlight color: Red (#FF4444) to indicate outstanding debts, as requested. This color will be sparingly used to draw attention to critical information.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for both headings and body text, providing a clean, modern, and readable interface on mobile devices.
- Mobile-first responsive design: The app will use a fluid grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Key elements such as sales summaries and action buttons will be placed for easy access with thumbs.
- Use minimalist, flat icons for navigation and actions throughout the app.
- Subtle transitions when loading data or navigating between sections, without being distracting. For instance, sales totals might animate upwards, when updated.
